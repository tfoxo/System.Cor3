# System.Cor3

* Simple abstraction library (used sort of like a include library) for CSharp.
* Also, some tools and apps built around with or without the Cor3 libs/includes.
* This project is in alpha stages (pre-release/migration) where more (proper)
  sources are coming and attention is to be paid to attribution in many of the
  projects that have not yet migrated up here.
