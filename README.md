# System.Cor3

simple little abstraction library (used sort of like a include library)
for CSharp.

## STATUS: MIGRATING (PRE-ALPHA STAGES)

> This is embarrassing!

## ISSUES

*ITS NAKED*

* NOTES OR PERSONAL ARTIFACTS NEED TO BE STRIPPED.
* CHECK FOR ANY EXTERNAL SOURCES, LICENSING ISSUES, ETCâ€¦

## PURPOSE

About time that my embarrassing code up here and there, so I no longer have
to worry about any more HD failures losing my codes in the process (again)
like what seems to have happened with a particular font, and the old
projects that many of these sources ended up getting consolidated out of
since I compiled my first CSharp app using a .NET-1.0 application soon before
v2.0 speck changed everything.

Perhaps some of this code may useful to others in their journeys.
