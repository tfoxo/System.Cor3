## NOTE

Note that the sources publicly available here may contain a few
un-documented materials including proper licensing as previous
generations of these sources started out as a collection
of demos based on tuturials, exercises and such.

Most of the residuals have been removed and I would be glad to
attribute credit where it is due upon notice.
