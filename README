System.Cor3
===========

Simple abstraction library (used sort of like a include library) for CSharp.
The project will most-likely be re-named to a more suitable name in the future.

## DEVELOPMENT PHASE

* PRE-RELEASE/MIGRATION/PLANNING
* NOTES AND/OR PERSONAL ARTIFACTS NEED TO BE STRIPPED.
* CHECK FOR ANY EXTERNAL SOURCES, LICENSING ISSUES, ETC...

The collection is a third generation collection elaborated during three
phases of development:

1. Collect organize and refactor 'common' sources from several dated
   study, research and practice projects.
    * Sources were are part of several projects and plugins for
      a particular study/sandbox project, "EFX" (Environment Framework).
    * Written while I might have understood half of .NET-v2.0 spec.
2. Refactorization and consolidation phase #1
    * Compile all sources to a single dll.
    * Sources were a part of a sandbox project.
3. Refactorization and consolidation phase #2
    * Migrate Core (common) Library to github.
    * Migrate Data Library to github.
    * Migrate Parser Library to github.
    * There are more csproj to migrate.

Phase #3 core projects (core, data, parser and friends) comply to some rules.

* Strictly dependent on Microsoft .NET Framework library.

## HOW WE USE DURING THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PHASE

[todo section]

A brief history:
This collection started out as a huge mess.  Much of my programming
experience was gained by of course studying the csharp language spec,
while consolidating and adding to the library over something like
5-10 years.  What eventually became a single library.
