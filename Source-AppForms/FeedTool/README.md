Feed Tool
===================

Introduction
-------------------------

FeedTool is a cor3/sandbox application that seems worthy of a little more consideration.

`FeedTool` design bares the following characteristics.

Features
-------------------------

* Multiple Feed Source/Inputs
    - OPML
    - Simple-Text-File
* Simple text-file as initialization file to load RSS/FEED urls from.
* XML/RSS Formats: PODCAST, YOUTUBE User-Videos, RSS/ATOM, XML/RSS (general feed)
* Implement cross-platform solution for AV playback of podcast or feed `enclosure`
  elements which usually point to mp3 or audio files as defined in podcast feeds.
* Additionally, the project was an personal excersize in using/testing a couple .NET
  [`Thread`][Thread] patterns including [`BackgroundWorker`][BackgroundWorker]
  in the windows-forms demo.

Future
--------------------------

* Integrate some features of a particular AvUtils application for the playback features.
* Parse/Check for OpenSearch and/or compatible information to 'page' content perhaps
  via application or global setting(s).

Build Targets
-------------------------

Windows Vista/7/8 (.NET v4.5)

### Adobe Flash Player

Adobe Flash Player (Microsoft ActiveX control version) is required to view YouTube videos and perhaps some multimedia (audio) files.
